Hannon Hill's pre-employment applicant's coding exercise

secret(x + y) = secret(x) + secret(y) holds true if x and y are both prime numbers less than N and if (x+y) is also a prime number

For Example 
Prime numbers until  20:  [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

if x = 2 and y = 5
then secret(2 + 5) = secret(2) + secret(5) holds true because 2, 5 and 7 are all prime numbers
